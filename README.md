# unity-eshop-poc

This is an extremely simple Unity project with an in-game "eshop". It is meant to use
[eshop-backend-base](https://github.com/jonisavo/eshop-backend-base) as the backend. It was created in
approximately two days for a university assignment.

It allows the user to register, log in, and make an order. (And by making an order I mean just selecting items to buy and that's it. Order details are filled in automatically.)

See [EshopAPI.cs](./Assets/Scripts/API/EshopAPI.cs) for the code responsible for communicating with the backend.
